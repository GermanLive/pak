            <div class="ui inverted red center aligned segment">
                <h2 class="center"><i class="large warning icon"></i>The Problem with Packages</h2>
                <h3>How can you control what files are installed and to where?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Currently, packages use different conventions for what files are included in the 
                package distribution and where files will be installed. For example: some packages distribute CSS files, 
                while others provide Less or Sass stylesheets. Some packages distribute raw source, others 
                provide only minified versions versions of source, and yet others provide minfied source with 
                map files. There is no consistent approach.</p>

            <p>However, we need to be able to install a package and customize how it integrates into our application.
                Currently, we have to manually copy required files out of installed packages. Each time the 
                package is reinstalled or upgraded, this manual process must be repeated. It can be automated by 
                custom <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> tasks, but there is no uniform solution for all applications.</p>

            <p>Pak addresses this problem by allowing each application to override how a package is installed. Pak 
            does this by adding an automated export step to the installation process.</p>

            <h2>Exporting Pak Contents</h2>
            <p>When a package is installed, Pak will first store the package contents locally under the 
            <em>paks</em> directory. This is a complete copy of the package distribution from the package 
            repository. This typically includes many more files than you need in your application, but the files are all
            there, incase you need them.</p>

            <p>Next, Pak will selectively export a subset of the package files from the <em>paks</em> directory to 
            the <em>lib</em>. How does Pak select which files to export and where to export to? 
            There are several methods for how you can customize what is exported.
            These alternatives are examined in the following order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use export override instructions in your application's <em>package.json</em> file.</li>
                <li>Use export override instructions from a package override file in your <em>~/.pak/override</em> 
                    directory.</li>
                <li>Use export override instructions from the Pak catalog.</li>
                <li>Use export instructions in the package's <em>package.json</em> file.</li>
                <li>Export all the files under the <em>dist</em> directory [default].</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some packages create a <em>dist</em> directory with a subset of common package files. If this subset
                is exactly the set of files that you want, then the contents of the <em>dist</em> directory will 
                be exported. This is the default if no export instructions are specified.</p>

            <p>However, if you want to override how a third party package is installed, you 
                can override the package by adding export instructions for the package in your 
                application's <em>package.json</em> file. Or you can create a package override file in the 
                <em>~/.pak/override</em> directory. Lastly, you can submit an override file to the Pak catalog so it
                can be used by all users.</p>
            <p>If you are a developer of a package, you can add export instructions to your package's 
                <em>package.json</em> file to export the most common subset of files. </p>

            <h3>Export Overrides</h3>
            <p>When you cannot modify a third-party package, you can create export overrides to provide the instructions.
                The syntax to achieve this in your application's package.json file is via a
                <em>pak.override.PACKAGE.pak.export</em> definition, where PACKAGE is the name of the package.
                For example:</p>
                <code>
"pak": {
    "override": {
        "jquery": {
            "pak": {
                "export": "dist/jquery.js"
            }
        }
    }
}
</code>
            <p>This example overrides the default jquery exporting of the <em>dist</em> directory, and exports just the
            <em>dist/jquery.js</em> file. It does this by overriding the jquery package.json export details with the 
            local application's definition.</p>

            <h3>Override Files</h3>
            <p>Override files in the <em>~/.pak/override</em> or in the Pak catalog have a slightly different syntax to
            handle different instructions for various versions of a package. 
            For example, here is a portion of the jQuery override file in the Pak catalog:</p>
            <code>
{
    "jquery/jquery": {
        ">=2.1.0": {
            "pak": {
                "export": {
                    "from":  "dist/jquery.*",
                    "trim": 1
                }
            }
        },
        ">=1.11.0": {
            "pak": {
                "export": {
                    "from":  "dist/jquery.js",
                    "trim": 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code>
            <p>See <a href="versions.html">Version Expressions</a> for details on the version expression syntax.</p>
            <p>Here are some example override files from the Pak Catalog:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak/tree/dev/override/angular.json">Angular</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak/tree/dev/override/angular-route.json">Angular Route</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak/tree/dev/override/bootstrap.json">Bootstrap</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak/tree/dev/override/font-awesome.json">Font Awesome</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak/tree/dev/override/jquery.json">JQuery</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak/tree/dev/override/semantic-ui-css.json">Semantic-UI</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Export Instructions</h3>
            <p>Export instructions in a <em>package.json</em> file may be specified two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Export properties</li>
                <li>Export scripts</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Export properties provide a simple, and flexible means of selecting and remapping the files to export.
            You specify the file patterns to export, the destination directory and other optional processing instructions.
            For example:</p>
            <code>
"export": {
    "from": [
        "src/js/**",
        "src/css/**",
    ],
    "to": "lib",
    trim: 1
}
</code>
            <p>This copies the files under <em>src/js</em> and <em>src/css</em> to the <em>lib/PACKAGE</em> directory 
            after trimmming one segment off the path. i.e. this trims the <em>src</em> segment from the filenames. 
            The result will be the directories <em>lib/PACKAGE/js</em> and <em>lib/PACKAGE/css</em>.</p>

            <p>If you are exporting a full path to the <em>/lib/PACKAGE</em> directory, you may use conventient 
            abbreviated short forms. For example:</p>
<code>"export": "*.js"

"export": [ "*.js", "**.css" ]
</code>
            <p>The export property can be set to a string, an array of strings or to object instructions. 
                In the example above, the <em>**.css</em> selects all CSS files in any subdirectory. 
                If the package already has an export definition in its own package.json file, then use 
                <em>=export</em> "assign" this export definition and replace any previous definition.</p>

            <p>The full set of export properties are:</p>
            <table class="ui table">
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>from</td>
                        <td>Filename patterns to copy. May be a string or array of strings. May include wild-cards.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>overwrite</td>
                        <td> If false, then files will only be exported once if they do not already exist. This
                        prevents upgrades from overwriting files.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>to</td>
                        <td>Optional target directory for the files. Defaults to <em>lib/PACKAGE</em> where PACKAGE 
                        is the name of the package. Use <em>${TOP}</em> for the application's top directory 
                        and <em>${LIB}</em> for the application's export lib directory.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>trim</td>
                        <td>Number of directory components to trim from filenames when exporting.</td>
                    </tr> 
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </ul>

            <h4>Wild Cards</h4>
            <p>The <em>from</em> property value (or the <em>export</em> property if it is set to a simple string) 
            may contain wild cards. The following wild cards are supported.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The wildcard <em>?</em> matches any single character.</li>
                <li><em>*</em> matches zero or more characters in a filename or directory.</li>
                <li><em>**</em> matches zero or more files or directories and matches recursively in a directory tree.</li>
                <li><em>!</em> Negates pattern. This removes matching patterns from the set. These are applied after 
                all source patterns have been processed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scripted Export</h3>
            <p>If you have export needs that go beyond what can be expressed via export properties, you can also use 
            the full scripting power of <a href="http://embedthis.com/ejscript/">Ejscript</a> to create
                custom export scripts. For example:</p>
                <code>
"export": {
    "script": `
        let path = Path('paks/jquery')
        for each (file in path.files(['**/*.js'])) {
            if (file.contains('min.js')) {
                continue
            }
            path.copy('lib/jquery/' + file.basename)
        }
    `
}
</code>
            <p>Pak supports an extended JSON syntax where multi-line strings can be used. Strings can be    
            delimited by single, double or back quote characters. Also, property names do not need to be quoted.
            However, if you are using the package.json for any other purposes, you may need to use strict JSON with
            single line strings only. In this case, it may be easier to put your export script in a separate file.</p>
            For example:</p>
                <code>
"export": {
    "script": "load('export.js')"
}
</code>
            <h2>Disabling Exports</h2>
            <p>The exporting of package contents is globally enabled or disabled for an application via the 
            <em>pak.import</em> property. Setting the <em>pak.import</em> property to <em>false</em> in your 
            application's package.json file, will disable exporting contents from any package. This property 
            defaults to <em>false</em>, so the absense of this property will disable exporting of package contents. 
            When Pak creates a package.json file, it will include a <em>"import": true</em> definition to 
            enable package exports for all subsequently installed packages.</p>

            <h2>Customizing the Export Directory</h2>
            <p>The export directory can be customized in your package.json <em>directories</em> properties. By default
            it is set to <em>lib</em>. To modify, update the <em>lib</em> directory property. For example:</p>
            <code>directories: {
    "lib": "www/lib"
}
</code>

            <p>Lastly, you can submit an override package.json for any package to the 
                <a href="https://github.com/embedthis/pak/tree/dev/override">Pak repository overrides</a>. 
                This works regardless of where the package is hosted, be it GitHub, NPM or custom Git repository.
                To submit an override file to Pak, please create a
                <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">Pull Request</a> 
                for your override file.</p>
