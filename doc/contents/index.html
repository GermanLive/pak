            <p>Embedthis Pak is a package manager for application components. Pak makes it easy to retrieve,
            integrate and manage components for applications. Unlike other package managers, Pak will 
            automatically install and configure downloaded packages &mdash; no more manual file installation 
            each time you upgrade a library.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://embedthis.com/catalog/">Online Pak Catalog</a> provides tested, integrated
            componens that are designed work together. Pak makes it easy to publish packs into the catalog and
            uses <a href="http://github.org">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://npmjs.org">NPM</a>
            as the back-end storage for packages. Pak also supports overriding and wrapping existing third party
            packages to customize which files are installed to where.

            <h2>Why Pak?</h2>
            <p>Existing package managers like <a href="http://npmjs.org">NPM</a> are excellent, but the 
            published components are typically tuned for <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a> and 
            not for general application or web components.</p>

            <P>Pak calls packages "paks" &mdash; this is not a misspelling.</p>
