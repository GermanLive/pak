            <p>Embedthis Pak is a genric package manager for application components. It makes it easy to retrieve,
            integrate and manage components for applications. Pak manages dependencies for you and automatically
            retrieves dependant packs if required.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://embedthis.com/catalog/">Online Pak Catalog</a> provides tested, integrated
            componens that are designed work together. Pak makes it easy to publish packs into the catalog and
            uses GitHub as the back-end storage for packages.</p>

            <p>Pak implements the CommonJS Package specification and uses Git as back-end storage for packages. 
            Pak calls packages "paks" &mdash; this is not a misspelling.</p>

            <h2>Why Pak?</h2>
            <p>Existing package managers like Bower are excellent, but the published components are typically 
            tuned for enterprise environments and not for embedded use. The Pak catalog publishes components 
            specificially tailored for embedded use.</p>
