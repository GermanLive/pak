<b>description</b>
       <b>pak  </b>is a generic package manager for applications.  pak calls packages
       "paks". this is not a misspelling.

<b>why pak?</b>
       existing package managers like npm are excellent, but they are  heavily
       focussed  the needs of nodejs and not for non-node applications. pak is
       agnostic to its environment and can be used to install  components  for
       any application.

<b>features</b>
       pak has the following major features:

           . install, list and uninstall packages into a local application
           . manages a local cache of retrieved packages
           . provides a global catalog to search for public paks
           . easy upgrading paks when new versions become available
           . automatically retrieves and installs dependant paks
           . supports the commonjs package standard
           . supports the semver package versioning standard
           . supports using github as the primary pak storage repository

<b>nice parts</b>
       while pak has a strong feature set, there are some characteristics that
       make pak particularly sweet.

           . fast, fast, fast
           . local cache of paks supports fast offline use
           . share paks by publishing to a common public catalog
           . catalog web portal to search published paks
           . pak integrates with the bower repository to  seamlessly  download
       bower components
           . package.json is compatible with nodejs.

<b>basic usage</b>
       to install paks:
           pak install names...

       to uninstall
           pak uninstall names...

       to list installed paks
           pak list

       to display pak dependencies
           pak depend

       to show what paks are present in the cache
           pak cached

       to download and cache a pak but not install in the local directory
           pak cache name

       to prune old versions from the cache
           pak prune

<b>overview</b>
       a  pak is described by a commonjs package.json file. this provides at a
       minimum the following properties.

            {
                "name": "package name - one word"
                "description": "package description - one line"
                "version": "1.2.3",
                "keywords": [
                    "comms", "websockets", "sockets", "ssl",
                ],
                "author": {
                    "name": "your name",
                    "email": "your email",
                    "url": "your web site"
                },
                "bugs": {
                    "email": "name@example.com",
                    "url": "http://example.com/bugs"
                },
                "license": "gpl",
                "dependencies": {
                    "name": "version"
                } }

       for more details, see:
           http://package.json.nodejitsu.com
           http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/packages/1.1
           https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html

<b>running</b>
       to run pak with more verbose trace output, use the --verbose switch. to
       run  with  less  trace,  use  the  --quiet  switch.   to run completely
       silently except for hard-errors, use --silent.

<b>publishing</b>
       to publish a new pak, create a package.json and then run pak inside the
       directory of the pak to be published:

           pak publish name repository password

       where name is the name of pak, repository is the github endpoint of the
       package and password is the password to associate  with  the  pak.  you
       will  need  this  password  to modify or retract the pak in the future.
       safeguard it well.

<b>configuration</b>
       on startup, pak reads  configuration  from  a  pakrc  file.  this  file
       defines the operational configuration for pak. for example:
        {
           "catalogs": [
               "http://embedthis.com/catalog/do/pak",
               "https://embedthis.com/catalog/do/pak",
               "https://bower.herokuapp.com/packages",
           ],
           "dirs": {
               "paks": "paks",
               "pakcache": "~/.paks",
           },
        }

       the "catalogs" property defines sites that index and catalog packs. the
       "paks" directory is the name of the local directory in which  to  store
       paks. the "pakcache" directory defines where to cache paks on the local
       system.

       pak locates a valid pakrc file by searching in order:

           pakrc, .pakrc, ../pakrc, ../.pakrc, /etc/pakrc, package.json

<b>commands</b>
       cache [paks...]
