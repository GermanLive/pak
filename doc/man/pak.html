<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Pak </B>is a simple package manager for embedding components into  embedded
       applications.   It makes it easy to retrieve, integrate and manage com-
       ponents for applications. Pak focusses on embedded  applications  using
       Appweb, ESP and EJS. It provides tested, integrated componens that work
       together. It is not intended as a generic package  manager  to  install
       complete applications.

       Pak calls packages "paks". This is not a misspelling.

<B>WHY PAK?</B>
       Existing  package  managers like Bower are excellent, but the published
       components are typically tuned for enterprise environments and not  for
       embedded  use.  There  are many files not necessary on smaller embedded
       systems and they are not  integrated  together.  Pak  focusses  on  the
       embedded ESP web framework and offers components specificially tailored
       and integrated for this environment.

<B>FEATURES</B>
       Pak is implemented primarily as a single script of some 2K lines and is
       very hackable.  It has the following major features:

           . Install, list and uninstall packages into a local application
           . Manages a local cache of retrieved packages
           . Provides a global catalog to search for public paks
           . Easy upgrading paks when new versions become available
           . Automatically retrieves and installs dependant paks
           . Supports the CommonJS package standard
           . Supports the SemVer package versioning standard
           . Supports using GitHub as the primary pak storage repository

<B>NICE PARTS</B>
       While Pak has a strong feature set, there are some characteristics that
       make Pak particularly sweet.

           . Fast, fast, fast
           . Local cache of paks supports fast offline use
           . Share paks by publishing to a common public catalog
           . Catalog web portal to search published paks
           . Pak integrates with the Bower repository to  seamlessly  download
       Bower components
           . Package.json is compatible with nodejs.

<B>BASIC USAGE</B>
       To install paks:
           pak install Names...

       To uninstall
           pak uninstall Names...

       To list installed paks
           pak list

       To display pak dependencies
           pak depend

       To show what paks are present in the cache
           pak cached

       To download and cache a pak but not install in the local directory
           pak cache Name

       To prune old versions from the cache
           pak prune

<B>OVERVIEW</B>
       A  pak is described by a CommonJS package.json file. This provides at a
       minimum the following properties.

            {
                "name": "Package name - one word"
                "description": "Package description - one line"
                "version": "1.2.3",
                "keywords": [
                    "comms", "websockets", "sockets", "ssl",
                ],
                "author": {
                    "name": "Your name",
                    "email": "Your email",
                    "url": "Your web site"
                },
                "bugs": {
                    "email": "name@example.com",
                    "url": "http://example.com/bugs"
                },
                "license": "GPL",
                "dependencies": {
                    "name": "version"
                } }

       For more details, see:

           https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html

<B>RUNNING</B>
       To run Pak with more verbose trace output, use the --verbose switch. To
       run  with  less  trace,  use  the  --quiet  switch.   To run completely
       silently except for hard-errors, use --silent.

<B>PUBLISHING</B>
       To publish a new pak, create a package.json and then run pak inside the
       directory of the pak to be published:

           pak publish NAME REPOSITORY PASSWORD

       Where NAME is the name of pak, REPOSITORY is the GitHub endpoint of the
       package and PASSWORD is the password to associate  with  the  pak.  You
       will  need  this  password  to modify or retract the pak in the future.
       Safeguard it well.

<B>CONFIGURATION</B>
       On startup, Pak reads  configuration  from  a  pakrc  file.  This  file
       defines the operational configuration for Pak. For example:
        {
           "catalogs": [
               "http://localhost:5000/do/pak",
               "https://bower.herokuapp.com/packages",
           ],
           "dirs": {
               "paks": "paks",
               "pakcache": "~/.paks",
           },
        }

       The "catalogs" property defines sites that index and catalog packs. The
       "paks" directory is the name of the local directory in which  to  store
       paks. The "pakcache" directory defines where to cache paks on the local
       system.

       Pak locates a valid pakrc file by searching in order:

           pakrc, .pakrc, ../pakrc, ../.pakrc, /etc/pakrc, package.json

       <B>--all URI</B>
              Show all versions of a pak.

       <B>--catalog URI</B>

              Change to the given directory before running.

       <B>--force</B>
              Force  the  command  to  continue.  This is useful to install or
