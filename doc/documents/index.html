            <p>Embedthis Pak is a simple package manager for embedded applications. 
            It makes it easy to retrieve, integrate and manage components for embedded applications. 
            The Pak catalog provides tested, integrated componens that work together. It is not intended
            as a generic package manager to install complete applications.</p>
            <p>Pak implements the CommonJS Package specification and 
                uses Git as back-end storage for packages. Pak calls packages "paks". This is not a misspelling.</p>
            <h4>Why Pak?</h4>
            <p>Existing package managers like Bower are excellent, but the published components are typically tuned for enterprise 
            environments and not for embedded use. The Pak catalog publishes components specificially tailored to for
            embedded but Pak can also install any Bower component.</p>
