            <p>Embedthis Pak is an Open Source package manager that makes it makes it easy to retrieve, 
            integrate and manage components for embedded applications. 
            Pak has an online catalog of packages that have been customized to support embedded applications including:
            Appweb, Ejscript and ESP.  The catalog has tested, integrated packages that are designed to work together.
            Pak is licensed under the GPL Open Source license.</p>

            <p>Pak implements the CommonJS Package specification and uses Git as back-end storage for packages. 
            Pak calls packages "paks" &mdash; this is not a misspelling.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Pak?</h2>
            <p>Existing package managers like Bower are excellent, but the published components are typically 
            tuned for enterprise environments and not for embedded use. The Pak catalog publishes components 
            specificially tailored for embedded use.</p>
