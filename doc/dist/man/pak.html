<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       <B>Pak </B>is a package manager for application components.

<B>WHY PAK?</B>
       Existing  package managers like NPM are excellent, but they are heavily
       focussed the needs of NodeJS and not for non-Node applications or  gen-
       eral application components. Pak is agnostic to its environment and can
       be used to install components for any application.

<B>FEATURES</B>
       Pak has the following major features:

           . Install, list and uninstall packages into a local application
           . Manages a local cache of retrieved packages
           . Provides a global catalog to search for public packages
           . Easy upgrading packages when new versions become available
           . Automatically retrieves and installs dependant packages
           . Supports the CommonJS package standard
           . Supports the SemVer package versioning standard
           . Supports using GitHub and NPM as the primary package repository
           . Retrieves packages using the Pak, NPM and Bower catalogs

<B>NICE PARTS</B>
       While Pak has a strong feature set, there are some characteristics that
       make Pak particularly sweet.

           . Fast, fast, fast.
           . Local cache of packages supports fast offline use.
           . Share packages by publishing to a common public catalog.
           . Catalog web portal to search published packages.
           .  Pak  integrates with the Bower repository to seamlessly download
       Bower components.
           . Package.json is compatible with nodejs.
           . Retrieve packs from NPM and bower.
           . Easy overriding to tailor packages from NPM and bower.

<B>BASIC USAGE</B>
       To install packages:
           pak install Names...

       To uninstall
           pak uninstall Names...

       To list installed packages
           pak list

       To display package dependencies
           pak depend

       To show what packages are present in the cache and  where  they  origi-
       nated
           pak cached

       To download and cache a package but not install in the local directory
           pak cache Name

       To prune old versions from the cache
           pak prune

<B>OVERVIEW</B>
       A  package  is described by a CommonJS package.json file. This provides
       at a minimum the following properties.

            {
                "name": "Package name - one word"
                "description": "Package description - one line"
                "version": "1.2.3",
                "keywords": [
                    "comms", "websockets", "sockets", "ssl",
                ],
                "author": {
                    "name": "Your name",
                    "email": "Your email",
                    "url": "Your web site"
                },
                "bugs": {
                    "email": "name@example.com",
                    "url": "http://example.com/bugs"
                },
                "license": "GPL",
                "dependencies": {
                    "name": "version"
                } }

       For more details, see:
           http://package.json.nodejitsu.com
           http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.1
           https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html

<B>RUNNING</B>
       To run Pak with more verbose  trace  output,  use  the  [-v]  --verbose
       switch.  To  run  with less trace, use the [-q] --quiet switch.  To run
       completely silently except for hard-errors, use --silent.

<B>PUBLISHING</B>
       To publish a new package, create a package.json and then run pak inside
       the directory of the package to be published:

           pak publish

       Where NAME is the name of package, REPOSITORY is the GitHub endpoint of
       the package. You will be prompted to enter a  password  to  manage  the
       package.  You  will need this password to modify or retract the package
       in the future.  Safeguard it well.

<B>CONFIGURATION</B>
       On startup, Pak reads  configuration  from  a  pakrc  file.  This  file
       defines the operational configuration for Pak. For example:
        {
           catalogs: {
               pak: {
                   list: 'http://embedthis.com/catalog/do/pak/search',
                   query:     'http://embedthis.com/catalog/do/pak/search?key-
       words=${NAME}',
                   download:          'https://github.com/${OWNER}/${NAME}/ar-
       chive/${TAG}.tar.gz',
               },
               bower: {
                   list: 'http://bower.herokuapp.com/packages',
                   query: 'http://bower.herokuapp.com/packages/${NAME}',
                   download:          'https://github.com/${OWNER}/${NAME}/ar-
       chive/${TAG}.tar.gz',
               },
               npm: {
                   query: 'http://registry.npmjs.org/${NAME}',
                   download:                                      'http://reg-
       istry.npmjs.org/${NAME}/-/${NAME}-${TAG}.tgz',
               }
           },
           "directories": {
               "paks": "paks",
               "pakcache": "~/.paks",
           },
        }

       The "catalogs" property defines sites that index and catalog packs. The
       "paks" directory is the name of the local directory in which  to  store
       packages.  The  "pakcache" directory defines where to cache packages on
       the local system.

       Pak locates a valid pakrc file by searching in order:

           pakrc, .pakrc, ../pakrc, ../.pakrc, /etc/pakrc, package.json
