.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPak\fR is a package manager for application components.

.PP
.SH WHY PAK?
Existing package managers like NPM are excellent, but they are heavily focussed the needs of NodeJS and not
for non-Node applications or general application components. Pak is agnostic to its environment and can be
used to install components for any application.
.PP

.SH FEATURES
Pak has the following major features:

    . Install, list and uninstall packages into a local application
    . Manages a local cache of retrieved packages
    . Provides a global catalog to search for public packages
    . Easy upgrading packages when new versions become available
    . Automatically retrieves and installs dependant packages
    . Supports the CommonJS package standard
    . Supports the SemVer package versioning standard
    . Supports using GitHub and NPM as the primary package repository
    . Retrieves packages using the Pak, NPM and Bower catalogs

.SH NICE PARTS
While Pak has a strong feature set, there are some characteristics that make Pak particularly sweet.

    . Fast, fast, fast.
    . Local cache of packages supports fast offline use.
    . Share packages by publishing to a common public catalog.
    . Catalog web portal to search published packages.
    . Pak integrates with the Bower repository to seamlessly download Bower components.
    . Package.json is compatible with nodejs.
    . Retrieve packs from NPM and bower.
    . Easy overriding to tailor packages from NPM and bower.

.PP
.SH BASIC USAGE
.PP
To install packages:
    pak install Endpoints...

Where an ENDPOINT can be the name of a package published in the Pak catalog, NPM or bower catalog, a GitHub repository endpoint, a GitHub account/repository or a path to a local package directory. For example:

    pak install jquery
    pak install pak:jquery
    pak install npm:jquery
    pak install bower:jquery
    pak install embedthis/exp-js
    pak install https://github.com/embedthis/exp-js.git
    pak install git@github.com:embedthis/jquery
    pak install ./my-source/graphics

To uninstall
    pak uninstall Endpoints...

To list installed packages
    pak list

To display package dependencies
    pak depend

To show what packages are present in the cache and where they originated
    pak cached

To download and cache a package but not install in the local directory
    pak cache Name

To prune old versions from the cache
    pak prune

.PP
.SH OVERVIEW
A package is described by a CommonJS package.json file. This provides at a minimum the following properties.
.PP
.RS 5
{
    "name": "Package name - one word"
    "description": "Package description - one line"
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "keywords": [
        "comms", "websockets", "sockets", "ssl",
    ],
    "author": {
        "name": "Your name",
        "email": "Your email",
        "url": "Your web site"
    },
    "bugs": {
        "email": "name@example.com",
        "url": "http://example.com/bugs"
    },
    "license": "GPL",
    "dependencies": {
        "name": "version"
    }
}

.SH RUNNING
To run Pak with more verbose trace output, use the [-v] --verbose switch. To run with less trace, use the
[-q] --quiet switch.  To run completely silently except for hard-errors, use --silent.

.SH PUBLISHING
To publish a new package, create a package.json and then run pak inside the directory of the package to be published:

    pak publish

Where NAME is the name of package, REPOSITORY is the GitHub endpoint of the package. You will be prompted to enter a
password to manage the package. You will need this password to modify or retract the package in the future.
Safeguard it well.

.SH CONFIGURATION
On startup, Pak reads configuration from a pakrc file. This file defines the operational configuration for Pak. For example:
 {
    catalogs: {
        pak: {
            list: 'http://embedthis.com/catalog/do/pak/search',
            query: 'http://embedthis.com/catalog/do/pak/search?keywords=${NAME}',
            download: 'https://github.com/${OWNER}/${NAME}/archive/${TAG}.tar.gz',
        },
        bower: {
            list: 'http://bower.herokuapp.com/packages',
            query: 'http://bower.herokuapp.com/packages/${NAME}',
            download: 'https://github.com/${OWNER}/${NAME}/archive/${TAG}.tar.gz',
        },
        npm: {
            query: 'http://registry.npmjs.org/${NAME}',
            download: 'http://registry.npmjs.org/${NAME}/-/${NAME}-${TAG}.tgz',
        }
    },
    "directories": {
        "paks": "paks",
        "pakcache": "~/.paks",
    },
 }

The "catalogs" property defines sites that index and catalog packs. The "paks" directory is the name of the local
directory in which to store packages. The "pakcache" directory defines where to cache packages on the local system.
.PP
Pak locates a valid pakrc file by searching in order:

    pakrc, .pakrc, ../pakrc, ../.pakrc, /etc/pakrc, package.json
